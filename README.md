# Traffic-light-controller-
Designed a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL based on Finite State Machine (FSM) to control traffic flow at a junction. Implemented timed state transitions for Red, Yellow, and Green signals to ensure safe vehicle movement. Simulated the design to verify correct light sequencing and timing behavior.
